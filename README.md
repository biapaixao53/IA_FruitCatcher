# IA_FruitCatcher
This project aims to explore the application of artificial neural networks in controlling complex systems by 
evolving a feed-forward neural network to play the Fruit Catcher game. The goal of the game is to catch 
the good fruits while avoiding the bombs (which are disguised as fruits). The objective of your work is to 
optimize the performance of the neural network using a genetic algorithm. Additionally, you should train 
a decision tree classifier to identify which fruits are safe to catch.
